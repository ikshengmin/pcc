"""Per-root unique-class preload deltas, computed in worker processes.

The coordinator's ``build_unique_external_class_preload_index`` rebuilds the
unique-class preload once per sensitive root -- 258 rebuilds over the other
391 modules, ~22 s of serial native coordinator time.  Each rebuild depends
only on the exports, so contiguous slices of the roots run in parallel
workers; the coordinator assigns type ids in root order afterwards, which
keeps the index identical to the serial build.

Wire: the exports file is the full-graph native exports wire; the roots file
lists one root per line; the result is ``_native_export_to_wire`` of
``((root, drop_keys, ((key, descriptor), ...)), ...)``.
