"""Versioned pcc-owned precise stack-map object-section ABI.

The runtime's existing registered-slot protocol remains authoritative.  This
module owns the *machine metadata* boundary needed to compare that protocol
with final self-backend locations without importing LLVM's stack-map parser.

All integers are little-endian.  Records are deliberately fixed-width except
for their location arrays, and every count is bounded before allocation.  A
relocatable object stores zero in ``function_address`` and carries one native
object relocation for that field; a final image must contain the resolved
address.  ``instruction_offset`` and ``exceptional_offset`` are always final
function-relative offsets, never assembler instruction ordinals.

Layout (version 1)::

    header      <8sHBBI     magic, version, arch, pointer-size, functions
    function    <QQIIII     stable-id, address, code-size, frame-size,
                            record-count, flags
    record      <QIIIHHBBHI stable-id, pc-offset, exceptional-offset,
                            continuation-id, location-count, reserved,
                            kind, flags, reserved, location-index
    location    <BBHHhiI    kind, flags, size, dwarf-register, base-index,
                            signed frame/register offset, extent

Version 2 interns the location lists.  Records no longer carry their
locations inline; each names ``location-index`` into one table that follows
every function, and identical lists share an entry.  A self-host link has
2,366,390 records that reference only 47,310 distinct root-set shapes, so
inline locations made the section 89.7% of the linked image (810 MB against
88 MB of code) — interning takes the same information to about 22 MB.  The
described root sets are unchanged; only their storage is shared.

The ABI does not contain a generic ``pointer`` location.  A location is
accepted only when it is explicitly marked managed; interior/derived values
must name an earlier base location.  This makes raw ``c_ptr`` ambiguity a
producer error instead of silently teaching a moving collector to rewrite it.
