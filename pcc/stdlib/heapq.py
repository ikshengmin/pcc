"""pcc.stdlib.heapq - pure Python binary heap, no libpython fallback.

CPython's own `heapq` opens with `from _heapq import *`, which is a star
import of a C accelerator: under `--python-libpython=off` that resolves
through `py_cpy_getattr` and forces the whole multi-file compile onto
libpython. `asyncio` imports `heappush`/`heappop` from here for its timer
queue, so that single star import was enough to keep native asyncio from
compiling at all.

The invariant and the sift algorithms are CPython's: for every index i,
`heap[i] <= heap[2*i+1]` and `heap[i] <= heap[2*i+2]`, with `heap[0]` the
smallest item. Comparisons use `<` only, as CPython's does, so any type with
`__lt__` works and no `__le__` or `__gt__` is required.
