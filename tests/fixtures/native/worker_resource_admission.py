"""One real process/admission contract for CPython and owned native execution.

The enclosing test runner owns the hard process-tree cap. These deliberately
small scenarios use the scheduler's documented local owner/worker accounting;
they do not replace or raise that outer cap. Reservations derived from observed
startup RSS are estimates, never claims of a sufficient full-task budget.
Native children self-spawn this PCC-emitted executable. CPython is a separate
reference owner. This component test does not prove pcc1-to-Stage2 compiler
worker dispatch; that still requires the real compiler workflow.
