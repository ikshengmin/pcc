"""`py_incref`/`py_decref` must refcount a user class whose tag exceeds 500.

User-class tags are handed out from `PY_TYPE_USER_CLASS_START` (104) upward,
one per class in the compiled closure; C-extension tags start far above, at
`PY_TYPE_CEXT_TAG_BASE` (0x10000).  Both refcount paths screened their operand
with `tag > 500 and pcc_capi_is_cext_type_tag(tag) == 0`, which rejects a user
class from roughly the 440th onward: `py_incref` returned without incrementing
anything.

Nothing small reaches that boundary, so the defect was invisible to the
gateway benchmark, to the bottom-line gates and to every focused test.  pcc's
own closure crosses it, and pcc1 therefore stopped refcounting some of its own
instances: a `_PendingMember` stored into a call's argument tuple (which
retains through `py_incref`) was released by the caller, freed while the tuple
still pointed at it, and the callee's adapter then increffed a dead object --
reported as `TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for +` from
`macho_archive`'s parallel member inspection, three frames away from anything
related.

These tests compile a program with more than 500 classes and check the
refcount survives a round trip through a call's argument tuple.
