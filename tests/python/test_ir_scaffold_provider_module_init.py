"""An elided scaffold import must still run the IR provider's top-level init.

In ``--ir-scaffold=on`` mode two rewrites happen independently:

* ``_filter_ir_scaffold_closure`` drops ``pcc.ir.compat`` from the
  source closure and substitutes ``pcc.ir.ir``, which holds the real
  definitions behind every emitted ``user_pcc_ir_ir_*`` call.
* ``_emit_import_from`` treats ``from pcc.ir.compat import ir_c as ir``
  as a compile-time marker import and returns without emitting runtime IR.

Together they severed the only edge that ran
``_pcc_py_module_top_pcc_ir_ir``.  The provider was still *registered*
with ``py_compiled_module_register_init``, but registration only records the
initializer -- nothing executed it.  ``@.class.pcc_ir_ir.IntType``
therefore stayed NULL, and the first ``ir.IntType(1)`` read ``cls._cache``
off that NULL class.  The failure surfaced as

    AttributeError: 'object' object has no attribute '_cache'

which is exactly where pcc1 died compiling C, at ``pcc/frontends/c/codegen/c_types.py:22``
(``true_bit = bool_t(1)``, three lines after ``bool_t = ir.IntType(1)``).

The defect was invisible whenever *any* module in the program also did
``from pcc.ir.ir import X``: that import is a normal sibling import and
did run the provider's init, so the program depended on an unrelated import's
presence and ordering.  Both shapes are covered below.
