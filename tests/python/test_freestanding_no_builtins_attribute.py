"""A freestanding module must not have libc calls synthesized inside it.

A freestanding module or runtime port *is* the libc implementation: it defines
``memset``, ``memcpy``, ``bzero`` and friends.  Any conforming optimizer is
entitled to recognize the byte-fill loop inside ``@memset`` and rewrite it into
a call to ``memset`` -- itself.  A real compiler prevents that with
``-ffreestanding``/``-fno-builtin``; the IR spelling is the ``"no-builtins"``
function attribute.

pcc emitted no function attributes at all, which is why nothing caught it: the
owned pass tier does not perform that transform, so the normal path never
exercised the hazard.  LLVM's ``default<O2>`` does.  Applied to all 170 runtime
archive members it produced a runtime whose every program hung at startup,
spinning inside ``bzero``, with no walkable stack because O2 had dropped the
frame pointers.  The defect was in pcc's emission, not in the optimizer that
found it, and it would bite the first owned pass that learns to recognize a
memset shape.

The historical LLVM experiment is preserved in ``experiments/llvm_reference``.
These tests check the owned pipeline that now ships.
