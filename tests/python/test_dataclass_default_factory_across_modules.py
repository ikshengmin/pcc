"""A ``field(default_factory=...)`` default survives a module boundary.

An importing module must be able to omit a dataclass field whose default is
``field(default_factory=list)``.  It could not: the field default is an AST
``Call`` node, the exported class signature is rebuilt from a plain
dictionary, and the rebuild recomputed ``has_default`` from a default that had
not survived, so the field became required.  The caller was then rejected with
``missing required argument``.

The cost of that was not academic.  ``pcc/backend/self_backend_ir.py`` ends
``ParsedFunction`` with ``aarch64_tail_call_ids: list[int] =
field(default_factory=list)``, and one construction site in
``pcc/ir/direct_indexed_kernel.py`` omits it.  That single omission
failed the stage1 self-host build, so pcc could not produce a pcc1 at all.
Two other construction sites had already been made to pass
``aarch64_tail_call_ids=[]`` explicitly, which is the shape of a workaround
rather than a fix.

The fix carries the factory name across the export as a plain string
(``export_default_factory_name``), so both the ``has_default`` flag and the
factory call can be rebuilt no matter which layer recomputes the signature.
