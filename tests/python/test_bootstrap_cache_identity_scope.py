"""The frontend IR cache namespace must not be the whole source tree.

Per-module cache keys already bind the module's own sources, its transitive
imports, the compiler binary's own sha256, the target, and the options. The
identity on top of that is a *namespace*, and hashing all 999 bootstrap-relevant
files into it meant an edit anywhere -- a GUI file, a runtime C source, a
documentation-only tool -- invalidated every cached frontend IR module.

`pcc/backend/self_backend_cache_identity.py` already solved this for the object
cache and says so in its docstring: "Hashing the whole compiler source tree here
would invalidate every object after an unrelated frontend, package, runtime, or
documentation change." These tests hold the frontend identity to the same rule.
