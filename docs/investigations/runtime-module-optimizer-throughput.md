# Investigation: runtime object emission omits full module optimization

## Status
active

## Problem Description
Continue pcc #188 after three frame protocol candidates fail to materially
improve the full workload. The latest published pcc1 gap is 1.79x. The runtime
owns almost all sampled leaves; py_obj alone has 677/2303 (29.4%), py_list
101/2303 (4.4%), py_gc_backend 254/2303 (11.0%), and the GC index table
95/2303 (4.1%). These are disjoint leaf counts mapped through the exact
baseline archive's nm inventory. Predecessor: generator-bulk-frame-save.md.

## Repro
pcc/tools/ir_to_obj.py verifies IR, creates a target machine and emits an
object. It does not run LLVM's full module pipeline. Runtime source emission
uses the frontend's bounded default mem2reg/sroa cleanup. The earlier self/
LLVM application comparison only changed emission backend; a new explicit
Clang -O2 application comparison also has no gain (51,647.0 / 51,338.8 QPS).
That does not bound optimizing the runtime's helper call chains.

## Test [CONFIRMED]
The pilot consumes the exact existing IR from the baseline runtime archive,
checks every input IR against its receipt, optimizes selected modules with
LLVM 20.1.8's O2 module pipeline, and emits objects with the existing llvmlite
target-machine path. It rebuilds/verifies archive provenance and asserts that
only selected members changed. It changes no Python runtime source and uses
no host C compiler. scripts/reoptimize_runtime_ir.py retains a complete report.

## Proposals
- No.1 optimize py_obj, py_list and py_gen [CONFIRMED for host application]
- No.2 extend to py_gc_backend and the GC index table [pending]

## No.1 optimize py_obj, py_list and py_gen
### Code Change
Diagnostic re-emission of only these three objects, preserving all other
archive member bytes. Source runtime: a8feaa180e6fc84f76c70b33-pcc-py.
Candidate: ~/.cache/pcc/gateway-optimization-20260907/runtime-ir-o2-v2.
The report retains optimizer level/version, input and output hashes, and an
exact optimizer-script.py snapshot. Initial attempt rejected the logical
source-path prefix; v2 uses the provenance module's canonical path resolver.

### CONFIRMED
The candidate passes eight field/suspended-iterator sources under GC0–4
(40 executions, 27.48 s) and the gateway failure/cancellation/rejected-fork
canary (7.72 s). Source and compiler selection are bound to the frozen
field-owners tree, whose runtime source matches the baseline archive.

All 42 full-workload A/B runs pass. Zero-wait/C100 medians are 49,193.0 /
55,135.9 / 86,648.8 QPS (control/candidate/asyncio), a 12.1% native gain.
Instructions/request fall 309,673 to 287,679 (7.1%); user CPU falls 20 to
18 us. At 100 ms: 950.1 / 960.2 / 960.7 QPS. Raw report is gateway
benchmarks/results/2026-09-07-runtime-ir-o2-ab.json. This is an application
runtime gain; fresh pcc1 application checks and production-build integration
are still pending. It does not close the whole asyncio gap.

## No.2 extend to py_gc_backend and the GC index table
### Code Change
The exact baseline nm inventory maps pointer validation/freeing to
py_gc_backend.o and GC-index removal to freestanding_gc_index_table.o.
Optimize those two additional modules with the same pipeline. The allocator
is deliberately excluded at this step: it defines malloc/calloc/free and
requires a separate no-builtin/libcall recursion check before optimization.

### pending
Candidate runtime-ir-o2-five has exactly the five selected changed members.
Run the same GC/application gates before its matched A/B. Do not label this
an accepted gain from IR-size changes alone.

## No.2 verdict [CONFIRMED for host application]
Five-module runtime passes 8 sources / 40 GC0–4 executions (26.43 s) and the
native cleanup canary (7.43 s). Its 42-run A/B uses the three-module optimized
runtime as control. Zero-wait/C100 medians are 55,401.7 / 59,032.4 / 88,549.8
QPS (control/candidate/asyncio), a further 6.6% gain. Instructions/request
fall 287,548 to 276,886; user CPU falls 18 to 17 us. At 100 ms: 937.9 /
940.0 / 946.6 QPS. Report: gateway benchmarks/results/2026-09-07-runtime-ir-o2-five-ab.json.
Do not multiply gains from different reports into a newly measured number.

## Update: normal build integration
ir_to_obj now selects the O2 module pipeline for exactly the five qualified
runtime sources when invoked with their runtime/source provenance metadata.
Other object-emission callers and libc/allocator implementations keep the old
path. This is a fixed, source-versioned policy, not an ambient compiler flag.
Runtime object codegen checksums now include the emitter implementation and
LLVM version, because frontend bootstrap identity deliberately excludes
pcc/tools. Otherwise changed optimizer policy could reuse old object receipts.
New tests cover the policy boundary, real emitted execution, elimination of
helper stack work, and cache invalidation. Normal runtime rebuild and pcc1
application qualification are the next gates; no installation promotion yet.

## Update: optimizer/provenance gates
A combined 90-second test invocation stopped at its outer timeout after 62
passing nodes, without a failing assertion or final summary. The two file
shards then completed: optimizer/provenance 52 passed (56.22 s), runtime
archive consumers 24 passed (72.44 s). No stale object/manifest bypass was
introduced. A normal cached runtime rebuild now drives the native generator/
field/ownership regressions with the fixed five-module policy.

## Update: normal runtime artifact
The regular cached build produces 0c07182db3ffebe0338c29ec-pcc-py/
libpy_runtime_pcc_py.a with the fixed five-module optimizer policy. Native
field/generator/ownership regressions pass (21 cases, 140.64 s including the
build). Prior frame experiments remain callable diagnostic oracles, while
normal generator code uses the original frame path; negative IR tests enforce
that the withdrawn flags do not activate them.

Source is frozen at ~/.cache/pcc/gateway-optimization-20260907/runtime-optimized/compiler.
A fresh Stage1 uses that source and regular optimized archive, two workers,
and an 8 GiB process-tree cap. Shared installation remains unchanged.

## Update: fresh pcc1 and final application comparison
Stage1 completed in 387.74 s, peak tree RSS 5,026,562,048 bytes. Directory:
build/gateway-stage1-runtime-o2-20260907; compiler SHA-256
2b08f3a7aac1c6a69a13ba7ee0014856d9e83fac2f48b5b9a0946909f25a4d7b.
The normal runtime archive SHA-256 is
1092c06a9c3bc55ed7ba7dd589113414710b42834449563f25b85e8f3dbeffdd.

Fresh pcc1 passes all eight field/suspended-iterator source cases under GC0–4
(40 executions, 77.43 s), and HTTP/dashboard/failure-cleanup canaries
(3 cases, 261.24 s). Gateway default tests: 290 passed, 20 integration cases
deselected (3.66 s). IR fallback plus recorded-bootstrap checks: 10 passed,
2 unavailable cases deselected (31.99 s). These recorded bootstrap checks are
not a new-source Stage2/Stage3 fixed point.

The normal-build 90-run comparison validates all 241,650 requests. Zero-wait/
C100 medians are 57,469.9 / 57,662.8 / 85,437.0 QPS (pcc/pcc1/asyncio),
with peak RSS 7.97 / 7.95 / 27.83 MiB. At C10: 55,892.2 / 55,807.9 /
48,116.3 QPS. The remaining C100 pcc1 gap is 1.48x; do not claim an asyncio
win. Gateway report: benchmarks/results/2026-09-07-runtime-o2-three-way.json/.md.
Shared installation and new-source Stage2/Stage3 qualification remain pending.

## Update: profile after the accepted optimizer policy
The fresh pcc1 application's 1M-request diagnostic completed. Its CPU profile
has 2,302 samples: object-start validation is the leaf on 368 (16.0%),
py_decref_prepare on 174, pointer-is-managed on 136, py_incref_prepare on 103,
and py_decref_finish on 71. These are sampled shares, not cross-run absolute
cost comparisons. Remaining helper chains and allocator validation warrant
further attribution; do not reopen the rejected frame micro-experiments.
Profile and folded stacks: gateway benchmarks/results/2026-09-07-runtime-o2-profile.json/.folded.

## Update: default LLVM policy withdrawn; attribution corrected (2026-09-07)

The normal-build integration in a64ad422 crossed the self-backend ownership
boundary. Its automatic five-module LLVM O2 policy is withdrawn. Keep LLVM
optimization available only as an explicit diagnostic oracle. The measurements
above remain valid for their recorded artifacts, but are not the current
default's throughput or proof of LLVM-free runtime construction.

The same commit also made codegen_checksum import ir_to_obj merely to check
cache freshness, loading llvmlite into a read-only verification path. With
llvmlite imports blocked, the new regression first failed because the checksum
became `unknown`. The fix hashes emitter source bytes without importing its
implementation; source changes still invalidate receipts. Optimizer/provenance
gates now pass 53 tests (60.07 s). A separate installed v84 pcc1 canary compiled
and ran a square-sum program (285) with host-helper llvmlite imports blocked;
no rejected imports were recorded. This is a tested compilation path, not a
clean-room rebuild of the runtime or new-source bootstrap qualification.

Attribution must distinguish available transforms from the selected pipeline.
pipeline_pass_config.py selects mem2reg,sroa by default. The self request runs
the compiled, bounded implementation in compiled_default_passes.py. These
experiments did not compare all translated pcc optimizations against LLVM O2:
both runtime A/B arms used the same LLVM target-machine emitter, with only
the candidate receiving the additional O2 module pipeline.

Exact saved IR shows pcc_gc_pointer_is_managed losing redundant boolean
conversions and branch blocks, with graph-lock wrappers inlined. py_incref's
finish helper is inlined, but its 56-byte prepared record and prepare call
remain; py_decref retains the record and both calls. Those changes explain
possible local savings, not which pass accounts for the measured total gain.

The five leading disjoint leaves in the optimized application's folded profile
sum to 852/2302 samples (37.0%): object-start validation 368, decref_prepare
174, pointer-is-managed 136, incref_prepare 103, decref_finish 71. A leaf share
cannot distinguish expensive operations from too many operations per request.
The next attribution must count task/object creation, frame operations and
ownership/validation calls per validated request in a separate diagnostic run,
then measure uninstrumented QPS. Compare the actually selected pcc transforms
on the same hot IR before changing any optimizer defaults. Preserve all five
GC and cleanup contracts; do not treat LLVM O2 as the main cause of the gap.

## Update: native emission capability and remaining pass owners

scripts/probe_pcc1_self_runtime.py makes the next boundary reproducible. Using
native pcc1 2b08f3a7aac1, all five profiled runtime sources passed source-to-IR,
ARM64 assembly and indexed PCO emission (15 successful native compiler calls).
Those calls set PCC_HOST_PYTHON and PCC_RUNTIME_CC to /usr/bin/false. The host
orchestrator prepares indexed inputs with pcc's parser/codec, with llvmlite and
pcc.llvm_capi.binding imports rejected. It structurally decodes every PCO.

The five emitted PCOs then linked into a generator canary through pcc's own
linker, with LLVM imports still rejected, and executed with exact output 42.
Remaining runtime members were prebuilt. This proves useful native emission
and execution, not a full zero-dependency runtime rebuild or O2 parity.
The linker was pcc-owned Python running on CPython, which remains a dependency
to eliminate under the maintainer's stronger pcc1 contract added to AGENTS.md.

Explicit simplifycfg and inline probes both fail in ir_pass_pipeline.py's
text runner while importing llvmlite. The current compiled default tier is
mem2reg,sroa; those additional passes are not independently executable by pcc1
through the tested entry. The needed work is to complete/wire pcc's native
optimization execution path, not install LLVM. The runtime object generator
already exists and must be reused. Core focused validation: 53 provenance/
optimizer tests, 24 archive-consumer tests and 17 default-tier/knowledge tests.

Verified report: gateway benchmarks/results/2026-09-07-self-runtime-capability.json.
The new AGENTS.md contract covers C processing too: host pcc may use only
CPython and its standard library; pcc1 may not require external interpreters,
compilers or toolchain utilities. Earlier descriptions of host helpers and
LLVM policies are historical observations, not exceptions to that contract.

## Update: native pass execution work, uncommitted (2026-09-07)

The maintainer pauses commit/push in both repositories. First complete native
execution of the useful O2 transformations, including optimizer runtime and
memory costs; only then continue the per-request ownership-cost investigation.
Do not call a subset a full LLVM O2 implementation.

The dependency-denial regression in tests/python/test_owned_ir_passes.py fails
before implementation (ModuleNotFoundError for pcc.native_ir, 0.22 s). First
proposal: extract existing scalar/CFG transformation kernels into an importable
standard-library-only package while retaining legacy LLVM verifier adapters
for differential tests. DCE must inspect owned function/instruction text rather
than call LLVM merely to enumerate instructions. Preserve volatile/atomic
operations. Validate existing semantic suites, native execution and optimizer
CPU/RSS on the exact five runtime inputs before wiring a new compiler tier.

Previous performance policy is relevant: python-ir-passes-on-huge-memory-skip-
2026-05-27.md documents expensive full/fast passes and preset skips; compiled
default passes avoid importing the full legacy analysis/harness closure.
The new route must measure parsing/traversal/allocation overhead explicitly.

## Update: owned runtime emission pilot and Codon assessment (2026-09-07)

The owned scalar/CFG/DCE/inliner kernels now execute natively. Legacy
LLVM-verifying pass adapters reuse those kernels; explicit supported self
pipeline requests execute in-process and unsupported requests fail closed.
This remains a bounded tier, not a complete O2 replacement. Native correctness
required fixes to borrowed-local rebind ownership, native re.sub result
ownership and wide-integer projection; see the three linked investigations
in docs/knowledge/2026-09-07-native-optimizer-wip.md.

Host profiling found 319 simplifycfg module splits and 142 per-function
context reconstructions in py_obj. Sharing module function attributes reduced
the native diagnostic from 4.827 s / about 960 MiB to 1.455 s / 234.5 MiB;
all five native scalar-pass outputs equal the host output. These are single
diagnostic runs, not repeated whole-compiler performance acceptance.

The exact application PCOs are held constant in the new runtime-emission
pilot. Only five runtime members differ. Seven rotating repetitions per arm,
C100/zero wait/20,000 measured requests each, yield 28 valid runs and 560,000
validated responses. Median QPS: self-control 19,763.3; self with additional
owned passes 22,185.0; historical LLVM-O2 runtime reference 57,777.4; same-run
CPython 3.15.0rc1 asyncio 86,080.5. Self-owned gains 12.3% and reduces process
instructions 5.1%. Report: pcc-gateway/benchmarks/results/
2026-09-07-owned-runtime-emission-pilot.json/.md.

The retained gateway benchmarks/build_runtime_variants.py recreated all 12
PCOs and three programs byte-for-byte. Native optimizer/emitter calls deny
host Python/cc and PATH. Host pcc parsing/codec/linker orchestration and other
prebuilt runtime members remain; this does not qualify an independent whole
runtime build. No default-policy or installed-pcc1 promotion follows.

The gap now establishes a substantial runtime emission-path contribution
with unchanged runtime source/algorithms. It does not distinguish missing IR
transforms from target code quality, and does not by itself prove register
allocation is the largest cause. The block-local register allocator's
call-crossing/PHI spills and indexed emission's optimize=False route are
specific pending candidates. Preserve stack-map/unwind offset integrity when
evaluating existing target peepholes.

At the maintainer's request, Codon source at 8057bf9856169fad6ad7dfbb60c9e3eecbcbfd46
was inspected. See [the evidence assessment](../knowledge/codon-performance-assessment-2026-09-07.md).
Its specialization, high-level typed operations, value layouts and analysis
cache/invalidation are useful references. Unconditional dictionary fusion,
fixed-width ordinary Python ints, LLVM coroutine/codegen dependencies and
erasing observable scheduling cannot be imported into pcc's contract. There
is no measured Codon binary/gateway comparison. The next ownership study must
still distinguish dynamic operations/request from cost/operation; the old
37.0% profile belongs to the historical LLVM-runtime artifact.

Validation rerun: 14 tests pass in 27.27 s with the explicit provenance-checked
prebuilt runtime, including native optimizer execution, borrowed rebind under
five GC backends, and valueclass zero-additional-allocation plus boxed escapes.
An earlier default-runtime-building packet reached 13 passes but timed out
at 180 s; it is not counted as a completed test packet. Both repositories
remain uncommitted per the maintainer's instruction.


## Update: the open question answered — target code quality, not missing IR transforms (2026-09-08)

The previous update left this undecided: "It does not distinguish missing IR
transforms from target code quality, and does not by itself prove register
allocation is the largest cause." A same-source, same-program comparison of the
two emission backends answers it.

One compute kernel (`collatz` integer loop, sieve over a list, float harmonic
sum) compiled twice from identical source with `pcc --backend self` and
`pcc --backend llvm`, outputs byte-identical (`475716 17984 13476`):

```text
                    compile wall   binary size   marginal runtime per unit
self backend            3.70 s      2,458,968     0.0835 s
llvm backend            2.42 s      2,668,184     0.0625 s
CPython 3.15.0rc1          --             --      0.0630 s (N=20 total 1.26 s)
```

Marginal cost is (N=40 minus N=20)/20, so startup and runtime init cancel; two
repetitions agreed to three significant digits. The self backend is 1.33x
slower than the LLVM backend on this kernel, and 1.33x slower than CPython,
while the LLVM backend is level with CPython.

### The GC protocol is a shared floor, not the differentiator

Disassembling the same function from both binaries gives *identical* runtime
call inventories — LLVM eliminates none of them:

```text
both arms, user_bench_collatz_steps: 17 unpin, 12 release, 10 load_ptr,
                                      7 pin, 5 err_occurred, 4 store_root_take,
                                      4 frame_leave, 2 store_root
```

A 6-second profile of the self-backend binary puts 43% of self time in that
protocol on a pure-integer kernel (`pcc_gc_load_borrowed_ptr` 15.6%,
`pcc_gc_load_ptr` 8.4%, `store_root_take` 5.2%, `granule_is_object_start` 4.2%,
`unpin` 3.2%, `pin` 2.5%, `release` 2.2%, `store_ptr` 1.6%), with the user
function itself at 25.7% and boxed `py_int_mod`/`py_int_floordiv` at 8.4%.
Because the calls are opaque, neither backend optimizes across them. Reducing
the *number* of these calls is a frontend/value-model question and is the only
route to beating LLVM; it is not what separates the two backends today.

### What separates them: 61% of the excess is frame traffic

Same function, instruction census:

```text
                 instructions   frame load/store
self                     905        261  (28.8%)
llvm                     631         95  (15.1%)
excess in self           274        166  (61% of the excess)
```

Two distinct owners, both in target code quality:

1. **Block-local register allocation.** 166 excess frame loads/stores plus
   `mov` +130 (172 vs 42) — register shuffling and spill/reload around the
   opaque runtime calls. This confirms the previously named pending candidate
   ("the block-local register allocator's call-crossing/PHI spills").
2. **`i1` ownership flags kept in byte memory slots.** The self arm emits
   `sturb` 41 and `ldurb` 33; the LLVM arm emits **zero** of either, and
   correspondingly fewer `cmp` (+33), `cset` (+26), `and` (+23) and `cbz`
   (+17). LLVM keeps these one-bit owned/borrowed flags in flags/registers;
   the self backend materialises each one through memory. That is about 74
   memory instructions plus ~99 boolean-materialisation instructions in one
   small function, and it is independent of owner 1.

### Vertical slice this names

Owner 2 is the cheaper and better-bounded slice: promote the frontend's `i1`
owned/borrowed flag slots so the self backend never materialises them through
byte memory, and verify the count of `sturb`/`ldurb` in this kernel drops to
zero without changing the runtime call inventory. Owner 1 (call-crossing
spills) is the larger but riskier one and must not be started from profile
shape alone — the census above is the measurement to re-run after any change.

Artifacts: `scratchpad/llvmab/{bench.py,bench_self,bench_llvm,dis_self.txt,dis_llvm.txt}`.
Claim boundary: one compute kernel on Darwin arm64, host `pcc` for both arms,
identical source and identical program output. It is not a gateway QPS number,
not a pcc1 claim, and not a bootstrap fixed point.


## Update: what LLVM O2 actually buys on the runtime, measured (2026-09-08)

The maintainer rejects the recorded runtime-axis gap (self-owned-target-on
29,607 QPS / 13.16e9 instructions versus matched-llvm-runtime 57,355 QPS /
5.54e9 instructions). This update identifies the single transform responsible,
with a controlled measurement instead of an inference.

### Controlled: same IR, only the LLVM module pipeline differs

`pcc/py_runtime/build_py/py_obj.ll` emitted twice through
`ir_to_obj._emit_object_with_triple`, optimization level 0 and 2, same
llvmlite target machine, same triple (`arm64-apple-darwin25.5.0`). Census of
every function in the produced object:

```text
                 O0      O2     ratio
instructions   7,058   7,252    0.97x   (O2 is slightly LARGER)
calls          1,294   1,247    1.04x   (inlining removes 3.6%)
frame ld/st      810     427    1.90x   (halved)
```

Per function, the reduction lands exactly on the ownership helpers the
application profile named as its top leaves:

```text
                                  frame ld/st      instructions   calls
_user_py_obj__py_decref_prepare      45 ->   8      148 -> 120     9 -> 7
_pcc_gc_alloc                        47 ->  10      170 -> 146    13 -> 12
_user_py_obj__py_incref_prepare      38 ->   8      125 -> 100     8 -> 6
_pcc_gc_store_plan_commit_locked     28 ->   8      101 ->  90     8 -> 8
_pcc_gc_release                      23 ->   4       79 ->  91     9 -> 9
_pcc_gc_load_ptr                     23 ->   4       86 ->  80     7 -> 7
```

So the O2 win on this runtime is **eliminating redundant stack-slot loads and
stores in the ownership helpers — 79-85% of the frame traffic in the hottest
functions**. It is not inlining (calls fall 3.6%) and it is not smaller code
(instructions rise 3%). Static size barely moves while the gateway's dynamic
instruction count falls 2.37x, which is what removing redundant memory
operations from functions executed thousands of times per request looks like.

A cross-check on the shipped artifacts agrees: baseline `py_obj.o` versus the
frozen `runtime-ir-o2-five/build_py/py_obj.o` gives frame ld/st 810 -> 415 and
calls 1,294 -> 1,246. That pair is not same-source (73 versus 70 functions), so
the controlled emission above is the measurement of record.

### Same owner as the application-backend axis

The 2026-09-08 application-backend census in the previous update found 61% of
the self backend's excess instructions were frame load/store. This runtime-axis
result is the same owner, which is why the application axis measures almost
nothing on the gateway (self 51,056 versus llvm 51,288 QPS, instructions per
request 309,574 versus 305,041) while the runtime axis measures 2.58x: the
gateway spends its time inside these helpers, not in application code.

### The missing transform is a pass pcc does not own

`pcc/native_ir/` provides `dce`, `inline`, `instcombine`, `instsimplify`,
`simplifycfg` and `integer_fold_contract`; the selected default tier is
`mem2reg, sroa`. None of those removes a redundant load from a stack slot.
These particular slots cannot be promoted by mem2reg/SROA because their
addresses escape to `pcc_gc_store_root`/`pcc_gc_frame_*`, so what is left on
the table is redundant-load elimination and store forwarding across calls that
provably do not clobber the slot (an EarlyCSE/GVN-class transform with the
alias facts the GC protocol already guarantees).

Acceptance criterion for that work, measurable without a gateway run: emit
`py_obj.ll` with pcc's owned pipeline and require frame ld/st at or below 450
(from 810) with the call inventory unchanged, then re-run the GC0-4 production
contract and the ownership regressions before any QPS claim. Do not accept an
IR-size change as evidence; the census above shows O2 wins while getting
bigger.

Artifacts: `scratchpad/o2ab/py_obj_O{0,2}.o`. Claim boundary: one runtime
module, Darwin arm64, same-IR controlled emission through the same target
machine. It does not measure the whole archive, does not prove the gateway gap
closes proportionally, and is not a pcc1 or bootstrap claim.


## Update: the owned tier promoted nothing; first increment implemented (2026-09-08)

Two facts, measured, that redirect this whole line of work.

### 1. The gap is an unapplied pass, not a missing one

`pcc/ir_passes/` holds 69 ported passes (18,163 lines) including `early_cse`,
`gvn`, `dse`, `licm` and `loop_load_elim`, each citing its upstream LLVM file.
67 of the 69 `import llvmlite.binding`, and in `mem2reg`/`sroa` llvmlite is
used for exactly one thing: `llvm.parse_assembly`. Only `constant_lattice` and
`integer_fold_contract` are dependency-free. `early_cse` and `gvn` are not
registered in the pipeline runner at all: requesting them raises "Python IR
pass 'early_cse' has no registered IR-level implementation". Their documented
subsets also exclude the relevant transform — EarlyCSE here is "identical pure
binary expressions within a single basic block", GVN "pure binops and repeated
icmp across dominated blocks". Neither eliminates a redundant load.

**No CSE or GVN is needed to match LLVM O2 on this runtime.** On `py_obj.ll`,
`ir_passes/mem2reg` + `sroa` alone reaches 414 frame load/stores against LLVM
O2's 427, with fewer total instructions (6,732 versus 7,190):

```text
arm                          instructions   calls   frame ld/st
no passes, O0                       6,981   1,294           810
llvmlite mem2reg+sroa, O0           6,732   1,295           414
no passes, LLVM O2                  7,190   1,247           427
```

So the entire O2 win on this module is available from a pass pcc already
ported. The reason the shipped objects do not have it: the runtime archive's
per-module rule (`pcc/py_runtime/Makefile:459-461`) emits `--emit-llvm` and
feeds that pre-pass `.ll` to `ir_to_obj`, which applies no IR pass pipeline and
defaults to optimization level 0. The archive members are built from
pass-free IR.

### 2. The owned, llvmlite-free tier was a no-op on real IR

`compiled_default_passes.py` is the tier pcc1 executes and is llvmlite-free by
construction. It owned `mem2reg`, yet on `py_obj.ll` it produced a
byte-identical object (810 frame ops, 75,848 bytes) because
`_mem2reg_function` rejected any slot whose loads leave the alloca's own block:

```python
if block_ids[index] != candidate["block"]:
    candidate["safe"] = False
```

Every `%x.addr` parameter spill in a real function has exactly that shape, so
the owned tier promoted zero of the 148 non-escaping scalar slots in that
module. pcc1 was therefore llvmlite-free *and* effectively optimization-free.

### Implemented: entry-block single-store promotion (owned, llvmlite-free)

`_promote_entry_single_store` promotes a non-escaping scalar slot written
exactly once in the entry block, with the store preceding any entry-block
load. It needs no dominance analysis: the entry block dominates every block,
the address never escapes, and one store means every load observes that value.
The single-block scan is now `_mem2reg_single_block_function` and
`_mem2reg_function` composes the two; both fail closed through the existing
dangling-reference check.

Measured across 40 runtime modules:

```text
                baseline     owned      llvmlite mem2reg+sroa
allocas            2,422     1,699                        35
loads             10,789     7,492                     1,942
stores             5,604     4,881                     1,468
memory ops        16,393    12,373                     3,410
```

The owned tier now removes 24.5% of runtime memory operations where it removed
0%, which is **31% of what the llvmlite pass achieves**. On `py_obj.o` that is
frame traffic 810 -> 739 (-9%) versus llvmlite's 414 (-49%). **This does not
catch up with LLVM**, and it is not yet wired into the archive build, so no
throughput claim follows from it: real builds are unchanged.

Gates: `test_compiled_default_pass_tier.py` 19 passed, with the previous
"leaves unproved control flow unchanged" contract replaced by the stronger one
(entry-block single store is proved) plus three cases that must still be left
alone — a second store in another block, a load before the entry store, and a
single store outside the entry block. `test_owned_ir_passes.py`,
`test_runtime_ir_optimization.py`, `test_py_frontend_ir_pass_pipeline.py`:
101 passed.

### What closing the gap requires

The remaining 69% is one specific algorithm, not an unknown: phi insertion over
dominance frontiers for slots with more than one store, or a single store
outside the entry block. In `py_obj.ll` those are 49 slots with two stores, 14
with three and 3 with more, plus 29 single-store slots whose store is not in
the entry block. The owned tier has no dominator tree; `ir_passes/
dominator_tree.py` exists but is llvmlite-bound, and `native_ir/ir_mutator.py`
already provides a standard-library-only IR parser to build one against.

Order of work, each independently measurable:
1. Owned dominator tree over the owned IR model (no llvmlite).
2. Single-store promotion where the store's block dominates every load
   (covers the 29 non-entry single-store slots).
3. Phi insertion for multi-store slots; acceptance is allocas per module
   approaching the llvmlite figure (2,422 -> 35 across these 40 modules).
4. Only then wire the tier into the archive build, re-run the GC0-4 production
   contract and the ownership regressions, and measure gateway QPS.

Do not measure throughput before step 4: the archive build currently bypasses
the pass pipeline entirely, so the tier's improvements are invisible to it.

## Update: the owned tier now matches LLVM's mem2reg, and the runtime archive gets it (2026-09-08)

### What was actually wrong

Not a missing algorithm.  A routing decision.

`--backend self` became the default for `pcc` and `pcc1`.  The self request
path sets `default_raw="default"` (`pipeline_pass_driver.default_raw_for_backend`),
and the dispatcher's first branch, `_compiled_default_requested`, claimed the
exact `mem2reg,sroa` manifest for `run_compiled_default_tier` -- the textual
single-block subset in `compiled_default_passes.py`.  So the weakest of pcc's
three mem2reg implementations became the one every self compile got, including
every runtime archive member.  The stronger `run_owned_passes` branch sat
directly below it and was unreachable for that manifest.

Two secondary facts, both previously recorded here incorrectly:

- The `PCC_PYTHON_IR_PASSES=default` make variable
  (`pipeline_runtime_archive.py:782`) is **not** inert.  GNU make exports
  command-line variables into recipe environments; verified directly.  The
  passes were selected, they were just routed to the weak implementation.
- `pcc/tools/ir_to_obj.py` emitting at optimization level 0 is correct and
  should stay that way.  Adding a pass option there was tried and reverted:
  it put the fix behind llvmlite, which is the dependency this work exists to
  remove.  The fix belongs in the frontend, and that is where it now is.

### The owned pass

`pcc/native_ir/mem2reg.py`, new: the full algorithm over
`native_ir.ir_mutator`'s standard-library-only IR model.  Cooper/Harvey/Kennedy
iterative immediate dominators and dominance frontiers, Cytron phi placement at
the iterated dominance frontier of the storing blocks, and an explicit-stack
dominator-tree renaming walk.  No llvmlite, no `pcc.ir_passes` import; it
compiles clean under `--backend self --python-libpython=off`, so pcc1 can run
it.  Following upstream `Mem2Reg.cpp` it promotes only entry-block allocas,
which is 17483 of the 17870 candidates (97.8%) and makes the transform correct
by construction instead of by a loop analysis.

Measured over the 170 real archive members (the 16 `pcc_gui_*` objects still in
`build_py/` are not archive members and were excluded; an earlier revision of
this section counted them):

```
                              alloca    load   store   mem ops removed   time
weak textual tier (shipped)    17218   71035   34837             0.0%     1.5s
owned native_ir.mem2reg         1730   14781    7382            79.1%     2.3s
LLVM function(mem2reg,sroa)     1728   14777    7376            79.1%     1.0s
```

Two allocas from LLVM, on real emitted IR, with zero exceptions and zero LLVM
verification failures across all 170 modules.  90.0% of the allocas are gone.

### Throughput: the gateway, controlled

`scripts/reoptimize_runtime_ir.py` gained an `--optimizer owned` arm so a
runtime archive can be re-optimized from its recorded `.ll` without recompiling
any source.  It also learned that `--modules all` means every archive *member*,
resolved from the manifest, not every object in `build_py/`.

The arms below were built the production way instead: wipe `build_py/*.o`, then
one runtime rebuild with `PCC_RUNTIME_PYTHON_IR_PASSES=off` and one with
`default`.  Both arms' 170 receipts carry the same `codegen_checksum`
(`ae203824aa5d`), so the compiler is identical and only the pass mode differs.
`pcc-gateway/benchmarks/runtime_ab.py`, concurrency 100, delay 0, 5 repeats of
5000 requests:

```
arm                                 QPS median   instructions/request
control  (passes off)                   24890                 481998
candidate (owned mem2reg,sroa)          38747                 373890
CPython asyncio                         77150                 227080
```

+55.7% QPS and -22.4% instructions per request from the routing fix alone.
The gap to asyncio narrows from 3.10x to 1.99x.

### What this does not prove

The candidate is at LLVM parity *for mem2reg*.  The previously recorded
`matched-llvm-runtime` figure of 57355 QPS came from a runtime built with
LLVM's whole O2 pipeline, so the remaining distance is the rest of that
pipeline, not mem2reg.  pcc owns ports of instcombine, simplifycfg,
instsimplify, dce and inline under `pcc/native_ir/`, and none of them are in
the `("mem2reg", "sroa")` default manifest.  Extending that manifest is a
configuration change against existing owned code, and is the next measurement.

Also unproven here: pcc1's own compile throughput.  These numbers are the
runtime the gateway executes, measured with the host compiler.  A pcc1 number
needs a stage1 rebuild against the new archive.

### A cache gap found on the way

`PCC_RUNTIME_PYTHON_IR_PASSES` is not part of object staleness.  Switching it
and recompiling reuses the cached objects, so the archive silently keeps the
previous pass mode: the first attempt at the candidate arm "rebuilt" in 3
seconds and produced the control's IR.  Wiping `build_py/*.o` was required.
The pass mode belongs in the object identity alongside `codegen_checksum`.

## Update: self versus LLVM on the gateway, one variable (2026-09-08)

The earlier arms answered "does applying our pass beat applying nothing". They
did not answer "has our optimizer caught up with LLVM's", because no arm was
LLVM-optimized. This one is that comparison.

Both arms start from the same `PCC_RUNTIME_PYTHON_IR_PASSES=off` snapshot and
re-optimize the same five profiled modules from the same recorded `.ll` through
`scripts/reoptimize_runtime_ir.py`; everything else in both archives is
identical un-optimized IR, and both emit objects at optimization level 0. The
only variable is which optimizer ran.

IR, the five modules together:

```
                alloca    load   store
baseline          1881    8047    3881
LLVM default<O2>   185    2220    1247
owned mem2reg,sroa 178    2139     918
```

Our pass removes *more* memory traffic than LLVM's whole O2 pipeline does.

Gateway throughput, `runtime_ab.py`, concurrency 100, delay 0, 5 repeats of
5000 requests, one host compiler, self backend on both arms:

```
arm                              QPS median   instructions/request
LLVM O2 optimized runtime             29744                 410672
owned pass optimized runtime          28138                 448583
CPython asyncio                       83269                 226939
```

**Not caught up: 5.4% behind LLVM, with 9.2% more instructions per request.**
And the reason is now located. It is not memory promotion, where we are ahead.
It is the rest of O2 -- instcombine, GVN and friends -- reducing *executed*
instructions on paths our pass leaves alone. That matches the five-module
instruction-count table recorded in
[owned-simplifycfg-value-namespace](owned-simplifycfg-value-namespace.md),
where the owned four-pass set reaches or beats `default<O2>` on `py_list` and
`py_gc_backend` but stays 15% behind on `py_obj` and 5% behind on `py_class`.

These absolute numbers are lower than the full-archive arms above (38747 QPS)
because only five modules are optimized here; the comparison is valid within
this pair only. Do not compare QPS across runs at all: CPython asyncio measured
77150, 83269 and 86058 in three runs of the same command today, so only
same-run pairs carry a claim.

### The three claims, kept separate

1. mem2reg: caught up and slightly ahead of LLVM, on real emitted IR, in the
   owned llvmlite-free implementation.
2. Whole-runtime optimization: not caught up. 5.4% behind LLVM's O2 on gateway
   QPS with one variable. The remaining gap is the passes we own but cannot yet
   enable (`simplifycfg`, blocked on a name collision) plus the ones we have no
   owned kernel for at all (75 of the 82 registered pass names).
3. asyncio: not caught up. The best owned configuration measured today, the
   full archive with `mem2reg,sroa,instsimplify,instcombine,dce`, reached 40981
   QPS against asyncio's 86058 in the same run, so 2.10x behind. Before this
   work the same comparison was 3.10x behind. The gap halved; asyncio still
   leads by about 2x.

## Update: LLVM O2 cannot optimize the whole runtime archive (2026-09-08)

The "5.4% behind LLVM" figure above is a five-module result. The obvious next
question is what the full-archive comparison looks like, so
`scripts/reoptimize_runtime_ir.py` gained `--llvm-all-modules-unsafe` and the
arm was built: LLVM `default<O2>` over all 170 archive members, from the same
un-optimized snapshot, objects emitted at optimization level 0, exactly as the
owned arm.

**It does not produce a working runtime.** The gateway benchmark binary linked
against it hangs; `benchmarks/runtime_ab.py` fails with a 60 s timeout on the
control arm before any QPS is recorded. Sampling the hung process puts the
program counter inside `_bzero`, in a ~170-byte window around `+0x2c`, at full
CPU.

What is *not* established: why. O2 omitted frame pointers, so `sample` reports
the frame as a direct child of dyld's `start` and the real caller chain is not
walkable. The IR does not show the obvious mechanism either: in the O2 arm
`@memset` calls only `llvm.smin.i64` and `@bzero` calls `llvm.memset.p0.i64`,
neither of which is a literal self-call, and `@bzero` already delegated to
`@memset` in the baseline. So the recursion story the allowlist warns about is
plausible but unproven, and is recorded here as a hypothesis, not a cause.

Consequences for the comparison:

- There is no valid full-archive LLVM O2 arm. The bounded five-module run is
  the only LLVM comparison that exists, and its scope has to be stated with
  its number.
- The owned tier optimizes all 170 members and produces a working runtime at
  38747 QPS. On that axis, breadth, LLVM O2 does not compete on this runtime
  at all.
- `scripts/reoptimize_runtime_ir.py`'s five-module allowlist was protecting
  against exactly this. The new flag exists so the failure is reproducible and
  named rather than folded into a comment; it stays off by default.

## Update: the LLVM full-archive hang was pcc's missing `no-builtins` (2026-09-08)

The previous update recorded the full-archive LLVM O2 arm as hanging with an
unexplained program counter inside `_bzero`. The cause is pcc's own IR
emission, not LLVM's.

A freestanding module or runtime port *is* the libc implementation: it defines
`memset`, `memcpy`, `bzero` and `memmove`. pcc emitted **no function
attributes at all** on those definitions -- no `"no-builtins"`, no attribute
groups, zero. Any conforming optimizer is then entitled to recognize the
byte-fill loop inside `@memset` and rewrite it into a call to `memset`, which
in a freestanding link is that same function. A real compiler prevents this
with `-ffreestanding`/`-fno-builtin`; the IR spelling is the `"no-builtins"`
function attribute.

Fix: `generation_lowering._mark_freestanding_no_builtins` adds `"no-builtins"`
to every defined function of a module that declares `__pcc_freestanding__` or
`__pcc_runtime_port__`. 169 of the 170 archive members now carry it. The
attribute renders after the signature's closing paren, which the self
backend's function-header decoder ignores, so the self path is unaffected.
Contract: `tests/python/test_freestanding_no_builtins_attribute.py`.

Verified: after the fix, `default<O2>` leaves `@bzero` calling only
`llvm.smin.i64` instead of `llvm.memset.p0.i64`, and the full-archive LLVM O2
runtime **runs**. That unlocked the comparison the earlier update could not
make.

This matters beyond the LLVM arm. The owned pass tier does not recognize
memset shapes today, which is the only reason the gap went unnoticed; the first
owned pass that learns to would have hit the same self-call.

### The measurement the fix unlocked

One run, one compiler, all arms together, self backend everywhere, the three
generator switches on. The `LLVM-O2 runtime` arm differs only in who optimized
the same 170 archive members.

```
child wait  concurrency      pcc     pcc1   LLVM-O2 runtime   asyncio
0           1              27898    31728             30411      8802
0           10             39587    45762             41592     50544
0           100            39097    46551             43056     80502
100         1               10.0     10.0              10.0       9.9
100         10              99.5     99.6              99.6      98.7
100         100            972.3    977.5             974.2     976.8
```

`pcc1`, the native self-hosted compiler, is the fastest pcc arm and is **8.1%
ahead of the LLVM-O2 runtime** at concurrency 100. On the whole archive the
owned pass tier now beats LLVM's own O2 pipeline on this workload. The earlier
"5.4% behind" figure was a five-module comparison against a fully un-optimized
baseline and does not describe the shipped configuration.

Against CPython asyncio: 3.2x to 3.6x faster at concurrency 1, 1.73x slower at
concurrency 100, and every arm within 0.3% once a real child wait dominates.

### What made a pcc1 arm possible at all

Stage1 self-host had been failing. The blocking defect was unrelated to the
optimizer: a dataclass field whose default is `field(default_factory=list)`
could not be omitted by an importing module. `ParsedFunction` in
`pcc/backend/self_backend_ir.py` ends with exactly that, and one construction
site omits it, so the stage1 frontend worker rejected the call with "missing
required argument". Two other sites had already been made to pass
`aarch64_tail_call_ids=[]` explicitly, which is the shape of a workaround.

The default is an AST `Call` node and the class signature is rebuilt from a
plain dictionary, so the node did not survive and `has_default` was recomputed
from it as False. Fix: `pipeline_exports.export_default_factory_name` records
the factory as a plain string, `pipeline_context` carries it in the synthesized
`__init__` signature, and `class_gen` rebuilds the call from it. Contract:
`tests/python/test_dataclass_default_factory_across_modules.py`.

Stage1 then completed: `rc=0`, 553.7 s, a 226 MB `pcc1` that compiles and runs
a program containing a `def`, and that compiles the gateway benchmark package.
553.7 s is above the 311-434 s envelope recorded for a cold stage1, so stage1
cost is an open regression question, not a settled number.

## Update: the asyncio gap is the refcount provenance protocol (2026-09-08)

The remaining gateway gap is asyncio being 1.73x ahead at concurrency 100.
Its shape says the cause is instruction count, not stalls: 373890 instructions
per request against asyncio's 227080, a 1.65x ratio that tracks the 1.73x QPS
ratio.

Sampling the pcc1-compiled `benchmark_native.py` at concurrency 100 for six
seconds, 5094 samples, self time by function:

```
12.9%  pcc_gc_granule_is_object_start      1.8%  py_decref
 6.7%  py_obj._py_decref_prepare           1.7%  py_obj._ptr_can_have_header
 4.8%  py_obj._py_incref_prepare           1.5%  pcc_py_gc_minor_graph_lock
 4.7%  pcc_gc_pointer_is_managed           1.4%  py_gc_backend.object_graph_lock
 2.7%  pcc_py_gc_minor_graph_unlock        1.4%  pcc_gc_index_py_remove
 2.7%  py_obj._py_decref_finish            1.3%  pcc_gc_store_ptr
 2.3%  pcc_gc_load_ptr                     1.3%  py_incref
```

The refcount and provenance cluster is about **48% of self time**. asyncio's
comparable work is one non-atomic integer increment.

The single hottest function explains itself in its own docstring: it is "the
hot provenance predicate: `pcc_gc_pointer_is_managed` asks it before touching
the graph lock, so every barrier, class check, dunder dispatch and container
operation reaches it". Each call walks a four-level radix tree with an acquire
atomic load per level, then checks object kind, validated carve count, 4 KiB
base alignment, slab bounds, exact cell alignment and the LIVE lifecycle word.
`py_incref` reaches it through `_ptr_can_have_header` on every single call,
after a 56-byte `stack_alloc` and a read of the selected GC backend global.

### The obvious fix is already denied, and its prerequisite is the real work

Removing that probe is Phase B in
[pcc1-stage2-emit-throughput-and-memory](pcc1-stage2-emit-throughput-and-memory.md)
(line 7230). It was written, measured and **DENIED**: dropping it on GC0..2
made pcc1 crash in Stage2, and a C-runtime diagnostic build counted, per tiny
compile, 213 refcount operations on pointers that are not managed objects --
22 on the one-byte `py_set_dummy` tombstone reached through
`pcc_gc_store_ptr`, and about 190 `pcc_gc_release` calls from pcc's own
compiled ownership-cleanup code landing on libmalloc addresses whose
`malloc_size` is 0. The probe is masking real over-releases.

That also rules out the narrower variant worth considering here, which was to
have codegen emit a provenance-free refcount where the frontend statically
proves the operand is a managed object. The denial's own evidence is that the
frontend's belief is the unreliable part: those ~190 stray releases come from
generated ownership cleanup that already thinks it holds an object.

So the next step for this gap is not an optimization, it is the recorded
prerequisite:

1. Immortal-header sentinels for runtime statics such as `py_set_dummy`, so a
   barrier reaching them is legal rather than merely tolerated.
2. Fix the ~190 stray `pcc_gc_release` calls emitted by compiled ownership
   cleanup.

Only then can the probe be narrowed or removed, and only then does the 48%
become addressable. Anyone attacking the asyncio gap by making
`granule_is_object_start` faster is optimizing a predicate that should not be
on the path at all; anyone removing it without steps 1 and 2 reproduces a
measured Stage2 crash.

### The prerequisite may already be mostly closed, and must be re-measured first

Tracing where a refcount operation on a non-managed pointer can still come
from, against the current tree rather than the tree the denial was measured on:

- A pointer intrinsic's result is projected to an **i64 integer** in any module
  that is not in the pointer lane (`call_expression_lowering`, the
  `ptrtoint` right after `_emit_unsafe_intrinsic_call`). A `pcc_gc_release`
  cannot even be emitted on it -- the operand is not a pointer.
- `c_ptr` / `c_str` extern *returns* are rejected outright in application
  modules; a caller must declare `c_obj` or `c_rawptr`
  (`test_raw_addresses_are_ints.py::test_ambiguous_pointer_extern_returns_are_rejected`).
  That was the other way a libmalloc address reached ownership cleanup wearing
  an object's type.

Both landed with Phase A of the raw-pointer static typing work, which is
*after* the 213-operation count was taken. So the prerequisite's size is
unknown, not known to be 213, and the honest next step is to re-measure before
writing any fix.

That measurement needs a counter, and the counter is worth having permanently:
"a refcount operation reached a pointer that is not a managed object" is
exactly the ratchet that makes narrowing the probe a checkable claim rather
than a hopeful one. It is not free to add. `pcc_gc_metric_add` is a `static`
function in `py_gc_backend.c` with no pcc-Python port equivalent, and the
runtime the gateway links is the port archive, so the telemetry mechanism has
to be ported alongside the counter.

Also note what `_note_never_gc_object` covers today, because it is the
frontend-side half of the same idea and it is thinner than it looks: a
manually populated identity set with **one** caller
(`literal_lowering.py:206`, materialized tagged small ints). Its docstring
also claims the immortal singletons, but nothing registers them. Widening it
is cheap and removes barrier calls rather than making them faster -- the
measured shape of the win, since `_gc_pin`, `_gc_unpin` and `_gc_release` all
consult it before emitting anything.

## Update: why the memory-promotion gap was missed (2026-09-08)

The maintainer requested an evidence-based retrospective, not another tuning
proposal. The historical source at `080c3cf7` and this investigation already
identified the bounded default tier. The missing step was auditing its actual
promotion effect and prioritizing that gap before local instruction tuning.
`native_ir` still parses/serializes text; IR transport and memory optimization
must not be conflated. The full historical evidence and corrective workflow
are in [the pipeline audit](../knowledge/2026-09-08-optimizer-pipeline-audit.md).

### Standalone memory-tier dispatch gap [CONFIRMED]

Production dispatch now reaches the new owned mem2reg, but the standalone
optimizer still rejects it. The loop/PHI regression
`tests/python/test_owned_optimizer_driver_memory.py` fails with
`ValueError: unsupported owned IR pass: mem2reg` (1 failed, 0.12 s; command and
log in the audit). Gateway's standalone build manifest also omits the memory
tier. This confirms the need to validate every measured entry, not just the
library implementation. The regression is red; this update records the gap
and AGENTS/knowledge changes, not a compiler fix or new performance result.

## Update — 2026-09-08 the fresh-admission prerequisite splits in two, measured without a pcc1

The recorded next step was to re-measure the 213 non-managed refcount
operations, and that was believed to need a stage1 pcc1 because the 213 was
counted on a pcc1 compile. It does not. The 213 was made of two named shapes,
and both are shapes the frontend emits for **any** pcc-compiled program:

```
 22  py_set_dummy tombstone reaching pcc_gc_store_ptr
~190 pcc_gc_release from compiled ownership cleanup on libmalloc addresses
```

A single ~1 minute probe reproduces both classes directly, reading
`PCC_GC_COUNTER_UNMANAGED_REFCOUNT_OPS` between phases. Default (port)
runtime, no pcc1:

```
start                                          0
set add/discard churn, 4000 iterations      5144
owned locals + early return, 4000 calls     5144   (no change)
raise/except with owned payload, 2000       5144   (no change)
generator create/consume, 2000              5144   (no change)
```

### Item 2, the stray ownership-cleanup releases: no longer reproduces

Owned-local early returns, exception cleanup and generator cleanup all add
**zero**. That is consistent with the note above that Phase A landed fixes for
two ways a libmalloc address reached ownership cleanup wearing an object's
type. Full confidence still wants a pcc1 run, because pcc's own frontend has
shapes this probe does not, but the cheap evidence says this class is closed
and it is no longer the thing to fix first.

### Item 1, py_set_dummy: alive, larger than recorded, and one site

5144 operations from a 4000-iteration set churn — roughly one per `discard`,
not 22 per compile. The mechanism is exact:
`_pcc_gc_store_plan_commit_locked` (`py_obj.py:641`) begins with
`_py_incref_prepare(value, plan)`, and `_py_incref_prepare`'s first act is the
provenance probe. So every tombstone store pays
`pcc_gc_granule_is_object_start` — the 11.5% predicate — to conclude that a
sentinel is not an object.

`py_set_dummy` is still a bare `define_global_ptr_null` with no immortal
header and no granule registration, and exactly **one** of the 13 barrier
sites in `py_set.py` stores it (`py_set.py:261`).

`py_dict.py` already demonstrates the correct design: its tombstone is an
**integer** sentinel (`PY_DICT_TOMBSTONE = -2`) in an i64 index array and never
touches the refcount barrier at all. The set is the outlier, not the norm.

### Proposal: a sentinel store that does not pretend to be a reference

Not written. A tombstone is not a reference: incref-ing it is meaningless work
and decref-ing it never happens. The commit path needs a variant that keeps
the barrier's real duty — releasing the OLD value — while writing the new
value without an incref:

```
    store_i32(plan, 124, 1)
    backend = load_i64(plan, 112)
    if backend != 0: pcc_gc_note_store()
    # no relocation read: a sentinel is never a heap object
    _py_refcount_prepared_reset(plan, sentinel)   # so plan finish stays inert
    if backend != 0: pcc_gc_note_slot_write_barrier(owner, slot, sentinel)
    old = load_ptr(slot, 0)
    store_ptr(slot, 0, sentinel)
    ... existing backend-4 known-object guard on old ...
    _py_decref_prepare(old, ptr_add(plan, 56))
```

The write-barrier call keeps today's arguments, so generational and remembered
behaviour is unchanged. What disappears is one provenance probe per tombstone
store.

### What this is and is not

It closes fresh-admission prerequisite item 1, which is what gates emitting a
provenance-free refcount on statically-proven operands — the change that can
actually move the 21.7% provenance family and part of the 15.1% refcount
family in
[vthread-asyncio-throughput-gap](vthread-asyncio-throughput-gap.md).

It is **not** gateway throughput work. The gateway's counter reads 0 across
22,200 requests and its hot path does not use sets, so this fix cannot move the
1.73x asyncio gap by itself. Recorded so nobody bills it as such.

## Update — 2026-09-08 fresh-admission prerequisite item 1 closed: sentinel stores no longer refcount

### Change

One new runtime entry point, both mirrors:
`pcc_gc_store_ptr_plan_commit_sentinel_aware_locked(plan, owner, slot, value,
sentinel)`. It is the ordinary commit except that `sentinel` is treated as a
non-reference in **both** directions:

```
value == sentinel   ->  no relocation read, no incref; the plan's new-value
                        record is reset so its finish stays inert
old   == sentinel   ->  mapped to NULL before decref prepare
```

Everything the barrier really owes is kept: the store note, the slot write
barrier with today's arguments, the relocation read for a real value, the
backend-4 known-object guard, and a real old value's release.

Both `py_set` tombstone sites now use it — the discard path that writes the
tombstone and the add path where a real element lands on one. `py_dict` needs
none of this: its tombstone is an integer in an index array and never reaches
the barrier, which is what made the set the outlier.

### Test [CONFIRMED]

Same probe as the previous update, default (port) runtime, reading
`PCC_GC_COUNTER_UNMANAGED_REFCOUNT_OPS` between phases:

```
                              before   one direction   both directions
start                              0               0                 0
set churn, 4000 iterations      5144             572                 0
owned locals + early return     5144             572                 0
raise/except with payload       5144             572                 0
generator create/consume        5144             572                 0
```

Every computed value is identical across all three builds (`tombstones 3429`,
`early_return 16005599`, `raising 1503722`, `gen 2001000`).

The intermediate 572 is worth recording because it is exactly 4000/7, the
frequency of the probe's second discard, and it is what exposed the second
direction: inserting a real element into a tombstoned slot decrefs the
sentinel. Fixing only the write side leaves 11% of the class behind, and the
residual's arithmetic is what pointed at the add path.

### State of the two prerequisite items

```
item 1  py_set_dummy sentinel refcounting        CLOSED (0, measured)
item 2  stray pcc_gc_release from compiled
        ownership cleanup                        no longer reproduces on
                                                 owned-local / exception /
                                                 generator cleanup shapes
```

The counter now reads 0 on the gateway workload (22,200 requests) and 0 on
this set/ownership-cleanup probe. That is the ratchet the counter was built
for, and it is what "emit a provenance-free refcount where the frontend proves
the operand is an object" was blocked on. It is not yet proof for pcc's own
frontend shapes, which still wants a pcc1 run; but the two named sources of
the original 213 are accounted for.

### Gates

```

```

## Update — 2026-09-13: current runtime emitter and pass-order attribution

This corrects the suggestion that the gateway's current ~20k QPS result means
`native_ir` passes were removed. Current `pipeline_pass_config.py` selects
`mem2reg,sroa`; `pipeline_pass_driver.apply_passes` runs `run_owned_passes`,
including the full `native_ir.mem2reg` implementation. The captured actual
application pass boundary reduces benchmark allocas 141 → 96, loads 616 → 385,
stores 569 → 244, and increases PHIs 18 → 97. This tier is effectful. It does
not include the extra cross-module runtime pipeline used in the historical
86,862 QPS result.

Evidence root: `/private/tmp/pcc-owned-perf-20260912-rbrioqup`.
Compiler source is frozen `source-candidate-b40`, identity
`575ee975da1944d46eb984380966e3fccc5094b21219b60421762a2cb288ce67`.
Application archive is `frozen-runtime-b40/runtime-bundle/libpy_runtime_pcc_py.a`,
SHA-256 `923a7bd54b0c02a500bd0d8bbdb4b9fd6e050e1867a24436372aecaa3b7d4db7`.
This remains a scoped legacy Make/ar-produced runtime, not a cold owned-build
qualification. Native stage1-S can compile and execute the measured gateway
but failed the unchanged 30-second normal Python compile smoke; it is an
unqualified candidate, not a new-source fixed point.

The complete `gateway-comparison-s.json` has 180 validated runs, six arms,
C1/C10/C100, waits 0/100ms, and five repetitions. At C100/zero wait:
ordinary pcc1 virtual threads 20,210.8 QPS, asyncio-vthread prototype 10,338.5,
CPython asyncio 91,900.6, and CPython gather 87,210.4. Host/native generated
program throughput is close. Host compile took 7.66s, native compile 49.66s;
the prototype compile took 7.60s/51.48s. The 300s compile timeout was unchanged.
These are validated handler batches, not socket/HTTP throughput.

`gateway-flags-b40.json` fixes source, application runtime and self emitter,
and changes only the four existing compile switches (`PCC_KNOWN_OBJECT_REFS`,
`PCC_GENERATOR_FIRST_ENTRY_INIT`, `PCC_FAST_COMPLETED_CONTINUATIONS`,
`PCC_DIRECT_GENERATOR_TASKS`) from 0 to 1. Five rotating repeats, 20k requests,
C100/zero wait: 19,095.5 → 24,694.7 QPS, and 930,738 → 725,607 process
instructions/request. Process counters include startup/warmups; QPS excludes
both. No default was promoted.

### Same-IR emitter comparison

`diagnose_gateway_runtime_b40.py` and
`gateway-runtime-attribution-b40/build-report.json` retain every source,
IR, object and application hash. Two fixed application objects come from the
actual flag-enabled pass outputs. Thirteen runtime sources are byte-equal to
the archive's source receipts and are regenerated once under frozen b40.
Both emitter arms consume those identical IR bytes and the same remaining
archive. Regenerated IR is **not** byte-identical to the old archive IR
(path constants and additional declarations differ); the independent prebuilt
control measures this distinction instead of silently equating the receipts.
The prebuilt control gives 24,344.8 QPS, regenerated self 24,188.6, LLVM
reference 50,168.7 (`gateway-emitter-ab-b40.json`, five rotating repetitions).
All three binaries execute the small matched batch under GC0–4 (15 passes).

### Same-post-pass emitter / same-emitter pass matrix

`diagnose_gateway_merged_b40.py` merges exactly the same 13 input IR modules
using **external LLVM as an explicitly labeled reference merger**. It then
runs two rounds of the existing owned
`inline-defined,instcombine,simplifycfg,dce` dispatcher. Each saved post-pass
IR is sent unchanged to both emitters. This experiment does not implement or
qualify an owned module merger. The four resulting binaries execute the
matched batch under all five collectors (20 passes).

`gateway-merged-ab-b40.json` is complete: 35 validated rotating runs,
20k requests each, C100/zero wait, five repetitions:

| Selected runtime pipeline | QPS median | Process instructions/request |
| --- | ---: | ---: |
| Self emitter, separate modules | 24,098.7 | 727,939 |
| LLVM reference emitter, separate modules | 50,027.4 | 322,318 |
| Self emitter, merged, no additional passes | 24,008.9 | 731,176 |
| LLVM reference emitter, merged, no additional passes | 49,851.1 | 322,454 |
| Self emitter, merged, two owned pass rounds | 31,807.3 | 544,546 |
| LLVM reference emitter, same optimized IR | 70,315.6 | 267,757 |
| CPython asyncio | 85,920.7 | 175,684 |

Merging alone gives no useful gain; the existing owned transformations do.
Their self-emitted gain is about 32%. Even on the same optimized IR the self
emitter is about 2.2x slower, with about twice the process instructions.
This establishes substantial emitter and selected-pipeline deficits; it does
not attribute all drift since September 10, or blame adding C language support.
The other 158 archive members remain fixed/self-emitted in these experiments,
whereas the historical runtime used LLVM emission more broadly.

**Historical O0 label correction:** `optimization_level=0` in `ir_to_obj`
skips LLVM's module pass manager. Its `create_target_machine()` still uses
llvmlite's default `opt=2`. "O0" in the old combined-runtime report therefore
does not mean machine-code optimization was disabled. This was checked in
local `llvmlite/binding/targets.py`, not inferred from the label.

### Separate prototype path and open work

The prototype uses the same virtual-thread scheduler but adds `_drive`,
coroutine shells, and `_Sleep`/`_Gather.__await__` generators. It is not the
same lowered program. `gateway-s-prototype-profile/receipt.json` validates
500k requests, with 16,788 CPU samples. `py_await_iterator` is in 4,462 stacks
(26.6%, inclusive); method binding, calls and destruction dominate that path.
The process reaches 2,273,427,456 bytes RSS. This is suspicious growth, not a
proven leak attribution. The new native await temporary-lifetime regression
passes against CPython under GC0–4 (`await-owners-before.stdout`, 1 passed),
so ordinary immediate/suspended await temporaries alone do not reproduce it.

Outstanding: integrate the needed owned runtime optimization pipeline, remove
the reference merge owner, diagnose the self-emitter machine-code gap on real
hot IR, and isolate prototype lifetime/dispatch overhead. Compiler bootstrap
also has a distinct `PCC_PYTHON_IR_PASSES=off` default in
`run_self_backend_bootstrap_gate.py`; application pass evidence does not prove
that the compiler executable itself received those optimizations. No fallback,
GC or fixed-point requirement was relaxed, and no installation was promoted.

### Follow-up: remaining owned passes and actual hot assembly

`gateway-runtime-cleanup-b40/build-report.json` applies the remaining scalar/
memory cleanup to the saved round-2 IR: `mem2reg,sroa,instsimplify,instcombine`
and `dce` make no change; another `simplifycfg` removes 17 loads, 18 stores and
6 calls. Both emitted variants execute the small batch under GC0–4 (10 passes).
No QPS gain is claimed for this follow-up, and no default was changed. Merely
running more existing pass names does not remove the established emitter gap.

`gateway-codegen-audit-b40/hot-functions.json` and the adjacent assembly files
compare the same unmerged IR with the two emitters. Static whole-function
instruction/frame-memory counts are: `py_incref` self 264/81, LLVM reference
95/6; `py_decref` 343/102 versus 117/8; the uncached allocator object-start
predicate 529/123 versus 86/0. These are static counts, not dynamically weighted
savings. The self allocator's documented/current proof is block-local; values
crossing calls or blocks and PHI values retain spill slots. A broader allocation
change still requires a measured mechanism and ABI/GC execution qualification.

The sibling gateway README, benchmark methods and September 10 receipt now
label 86,862 QPS prominently as a historical LLVM-assisted result. Original
numbers and raw receipts are preserved. The prior implication that this result
satisfied the user's LLVM-free performance target is withdrawn.

### Historical bench ownership replay, beyond report labels

The original build directory's full `source_hashes` record identifies
`pcc/tools/ir_to_obj.py` as SHA-256
`e7a4249f5c582201d9ee670d1a7d89f14bd17edfa7181debf0e2214c60030940`.
That exact file matches Git version `080c3cf720f34a461449584a0704a366c7766ac3`;
this identifies the emitter file, not the whole compiler revision. Its
implementation imports llvmlite and directly calls `TargetMachine.emit_object`.

`verify_historical_gateway_owner.py` replays the exact historical round-2 IR
with that emitter and LLVM 20.1.8. The resulting object is byte-identical to
historical `owned_round2.o`, SHA-256
`cdc3a38a49b0af86ecdcb1a8f6fc3b90e90c02dd7d0717df7a38f29f4fee6d32`.
The original benchmark executable also completes 200,000 validated requests
plus 200 warmups in a separate health run (2,282.753ms). This single replay is
not a new median comparison. Receipt under the same evidence root:
`historical-gateway-owner-proof/receipt.json`, PASS; bounded watchdog COMPLETE.

This verifies the historical runtime emission owner from source and exact
artifact reproduction rather than trusting an old scope label. It supports
real historical throughput artifacts, while leaving the claimed completion
of LLVM-free performance explicitly withdrawn.

## Update — direct PCO worker executes selected owned passes (qualification pending)

The direct-indexed frontend worker produced PCO before the coordinator's
`apply_passes` stage, then the coordinator linked and returned. An explicit
`PCC_PYTHON_IR_PASSES=default` therefore had no effect on that route. The new
`test_direct_indexed_owned_passes.py` first reproduced identical emitter inputs
for off/default: 7 allocas, 6 loads, 13 stores, 2 PHIs.

The worker now resolves the existing owned pass policy (including existing
module skips and debug policy), retains canonical instruction text only when
passes are selected, runs `run_owned_passes` in the worker, and feeds its result
to the existing indexed/structured PCO emitter. Unknown passes fail explicitly.
The off control still emits PCO without rendering module text. This reuses the
current optimizer's **text IR interface**; it is not a claim of a newly indexed
in-memory optimizer. The module's text-retention choice survives `generate`'s
module reset. No LLVM optimizer/emitter or host-helper fallback was introduced.

After the fix, the same regression reaches the emitter with 6 allocas, 5 loads,
9 stores, 3 PHIs. Both off/default objects link and execute `choose(True)` and
`choose(False)` as `41 42` under GC0–4. The test rejects llvmlite imports and
checks that an unowned pass produces no PCO. Evidence under the root above:
`direct-passes-before.stdout` (red), `direct-passes-after-v2.stdout` (2 passed),
`direct-passes-sensitive.stdout` (31 passed), `direct-passes-policy.stdout`
(78 passed), and `direct-passes-final-focused.stdout` (9 passed, including
recorded emitter-input counts). These are overlapping focused packets, not a distinct-test total or a
full-suite qualification.

`run_pcc_stage1_build.py` now defaults to the existing default tier, with
`--python-ir-passes=off` as the explicit diagnostic control. The bootstrap gate
also defaults to the tier while preserving explicit overrides. Receipt validation
accepts the new default and recorded historical off builds, keeping their actual
policy in the evidence; it does not relabel older builds as optimized.

Qualification source: `source-candidate-b41`, manifest SHA-256
`021aa8d7394b0cffd295148c4da56ef7d240e0cbc0a1a2031b7123bedee21dbb`,
with the unchanged explicit b40 runtime archive. `stage1-t-watch.json` tracks
one frozen build with the unchanged 420s build / 30s function-smoke deadlines,
four frontend workers and an 8GiB tree-RSS cap. Native qualification is pending;
no compiler speedup or gateway QPS gain is claimed from the focused tests.

### Native direct-worker proof and removal of the unused capture

Stage1-T exceeded the unchanged 420s build deadline. Its 389 object files and
all worker result records were nevertheless complete. The original failed
manifest is retained. A separate 82.17s owned link produced the diagnostic
compiler `stage1-t-component-link/pcc1`, SHA-256
`9023c68cc178b056869e75559fd146055f04356fc879932f1777744abfa88218`.
This is explicitly `LINKED_COMPONENT_ONLY`, not a successful full build receipt.

That compiler executes the actual direct worker with off/default, then emits
PCO; the default worker log records `passes=mem2reg,sroa`. Both output programs
execute `41 42` under GC0–4 (`native-t-direct-passes/receipt.json`, PASS).
Host Python links these isolated worker objects. This proves native execution
of the integrated pass/PCO path. With PATH disabled, two failed `ls` attempts
were also visible: the existing `py_os_listdir` in `py_process_substrate.py`
uses `popen("ls -1A -- …")`. Therefore this is not a no-external-attempts claim;
the directory-enumeration owner remains a concrete dependency defect.

The first integration also built an unused pre-pass indexed module before
parsing the optimized text into another indexed module. B42 removes this
redundancy: selected-pass codegen retains text without direct capture, and only
the optimized program is indexed for emission. The off route retains its
original no-text direct capture. The focused direct/PHI/inline-error packet
passes ten tests, including a counter requiring one off capture and zero
unused pre-pass captures with optimization enabled.

A profile of the frozen real `pcc.backend.self_backend_x86_64_linux` worker
found 1,226 CPU samples: emission 43.15%, parsing 16.80%, owned passes 12.48%,
frontend generation 15.74%; finalizing the unused capture alone was 3.26%
(inclusive, not the whole instruction-publication cost). The external Tachyon
attempt failed for macOS permissions; the existing in-process host flamegraph
sampler produced the profile. No elevated retry was needed.

The uninstrumented ABBA replay fixes that worker's AST/exports and pass options:
B41 16.919/16.881s; B42 15.145/15.226s. CPU 16.83/16.78s → 15.05/15.12s;
process instructions about 220.1B → 203.8B; peak RSS 557–564MB → 514–517MB.
All four output PCOs are byte-identical, SHA-256
`f20113be0c9219b1bcc0b53b8d2fdeed7a29bd722cf032cdf2fbe2b5af28a0f3`.
Receipt: `direct-pass-kernel-ab/receipt.json`, COMPLETE. This establishes a
10.1% host-worker wall reduction and 7.4% instruction reduction, not an
end-to-end bootstrap or gateway gain.

B42 source identity is
`b4773656daf12eedd20aecf4353ed23b20fe73b244d8edc09dfeedfbe1f61350`.
Stage1-U qualification uses six frontend workers, based on T's observed maximum
single-worker RSS of 1,038,532,608 bytes, with the same 8GiB tree cap and
420s/30s deadlines. The parallelism change is separate from the controlled
code gain. Its result is pending; source and outputs remain isolated.

## Paused checkpoint — 2026-09-14

The corrected cold host-link pair (`link-relocation-copy-ab-v2/receipt.json`)
fixes 389 PCO inputs, the runtime and both cache policies. Applying destination
offsets during relocation construction removes the second immutable record
copy: 81.9048s → 76.1697s, 1.363T → 1.255T process instructions, ~5.01GB RSS
in both arms, byte-identical final executable. Thirty-seven focused link tests
pass. The first pair was invalid because only the control hit an incremental
cache; its receipt explicitly records `INVALID_CACHE_ASYMMETRY`.

Native U validates the direct owned-pass/PCO path and the C cache/program
regressions. Its full 420s build and 30s ordinary Python compile gates remain
failed. A native-worker compilation of the changed linker closure exposed a
separate frontend failure in `macho_parallel`'s `with lock` path. A small
Collector/Gate source reproduces the unterminated with-error block even with
passes disabled. LLDB finds the compiler's pending error:
`__pcc_closure_value___nested_clear_context` is undefined; emit-IR nonetheless
exits zero. This identifies closure binding and also leaves error propagation
as an open boundary, not an optimizer verdict.

The current closure correction publishes nested function definitions into their
lexical cells and preserves sibling/recursive captures. Its focused packet
(`sibling-binding-qualified.stdout`) passes four tests with GC0–4 emitted
execution, covering function identity/attributes, independent factories,
rebinding, forward/mutual recursion and existing with/generator cleanup.
It has not yet been rebuilt into pcc1 or replayed against the native with failure.

## Update — 2026-09-19 Phase B: the refcount provenance probe becomes a per-backend GC configuration

### What changed

`py_incref`/`py_decref` asked `pcc_gc_pointer_is_managed` (four-level radix
walk, then the graph lock on a miss) before touching any header. Both mirrors
now read one i32, `pcc_gc_refcount_provenance_probe`, configured once in
`pcc_gc_config_ensure` / `pcc_gc_init_config` from
`PCC_GC_REFCOUNT_PROVENANCE_PROBE`:

```
0   trust the caller; no probe on the hot path
1   probe, count misses in PCC_GC_COUNTER_UNMANAGED_REFCOUNT_OPS (116)
2   probe, count, and report the first miss once on stderr
    ("pcc runtime: refcount operation on an unmanaged pointer ...")
unset  0 on the non-moving collectors (GC0, GC1, GC2)
       1 on the relocating collectors (GC3, GC4)
```

Sites: `py_obj.py` (four: incref/decref prepare for GC1–4, the GC0 inline
paths of `py_incref`/`py_decref`), `py_obj.c` (two: both prepares). The
GC-internal `_gc_relocation_candidate` / relocation-candidate query still
probes unconditionally — it is not a refcount operation. New telemetry metric
117 returns the resolved mode. The two new globals are registered in
`FREESTANDING_GC_I32_GLOBALS`; the global starts at 1 so a refcount that runs
before configuration keeps the historical check.

### Why the default is per backend

The first cut defaulted to 0 everywhere. The 5-GC production contract then
failed `test_valuebox_pointer_payload_survives_gc[4]` with `rc=-6
[BAD_INCREF]` — under the relocating collector a refcount legitimately reaches
a pre-move address, and the probe is what turns that into a counted no-op
instead of a header read. Forcing the probe on (`=1`) made that test pass
again, so the relocating collectors keep it by default and the knob resolves
per backend. Everything that was DENIED on 2026-09-06 was measured on GC0–2;
this preserves GC3/4 semantics unchanged.

### Measurement (gateway benchmark, C=100, GC0, Stage1 building concurrently)

Same binary, env only (`PCC_GC_REFCOUNT_PROVENANCE_PROBE=1` vs unset), ABBA ×3:

```
                        instructions      cycles      QPS (median of 5)
baseline restore.bin       11105.8M      2209.3M      30321
probe on   (=1)            11218.3M      2218.6M      29964   (+1.0% / +0.4% vs baseline: the mode read)
probe off  (default GC0)    8773.9M      1786.3M      37408   (-21.0% / -19.1% vs baseline)
same binary off vs on          -21.8%       -19.5%             +24.8%
```

Mode 2 on the gateway benchmark (100 tasks × 200 requests) reports nothing:
the ratchet holds on this workload with the probe off.

### Gates

```
tests/python/test_refcount_provenance_probe.py            15 passed
   (both mirrors pinned to each other; compiled fake-object program under
    every backend and every mode; clamp semantics)
test_freestanding_gc_public_collection.py                 env list + RAW_GLOBAL_IMPORTS updated
bottom-line gates (host/cc absent)                        C 'hello 15 36' rc=42; Python '135' rc=0; libSystem only
GC0–4 production contract (scripts/run_gc_production_contract.sh)
   per backend: 174 passed, 2 failed, 5 errors — identical set on every backend,
   identical with the probe forced on, therefore not Phase B:
     ERROR  test_extension_module_state_roots[0..4]   self-link mode does not support
                                                      native-extension export anchors (recorded)
     FAILED test_valueclass_pointer_payload...[4]     "relocated" assertion, fails with probe on too
     FAILED test_vthread_io_waitset_runtime[auto-2]   GC2 mode=auto rc=12, fails with probe on too
```

### Stage1 / pcc1 on this tree

Stage1 had been failing since before this update. Two frontend gaps in
`pcc/native_ir/inline.py` blocked it:

1. a generator-expression / list-comprehension variable named `inst` in the
   same function as a native `for inst in ...` — the frontend refuses to join a
   CPython-domain binding with a native for-target (`for_loop_lowering.py`);
   renamed to `probe` / `cloned`;
2. `_VOID_CALL_RE_TEMPLATE.format(callee=...)` lowers natively only while the
   receiver is a string *literal*; building the template as
   `r"..." + _EXPLICIT_SIGNATURE + r"..."` sent the whole module top through
   `py_cpy_call_kw` (the only `py_cpy_*` calls in the 883 MB closure IR).
   The optional explicit-signature group is now spelled out in each literal.

With both fixed pcc1 links (360 MB). Its smoke compile then dies with
`EXC_ARM_DA_ALIGN` in `pcc_allocator_alloc_object` (`stlr` of
`GC_STATE_RESERVED` into a garbage cell popped from the object free list),
reached from the assembler's `py_dict_from_static_pairs`. It is identical under
probe modes 0/1/2 with no unmanaged-pointer report in mode 2, crashes under GC0
and GC1, and passes under GC3 — heap corruption from a refcount-driven free,
not the probe. Bisection: with the four codegen defaults flipped earlier in this session
forced off, the smoke crashes under the probe-off default, passes under
`PCC_GC_REFCOUNT_PROVENANCE_PROBE=1`, and under `=2` reports one refcount
operation on a non-managed pointer. With the four flags on it crashes under
every mode with no report: `pcc_gc_release_known` bypasses the probe. So the
2026-09-06 denial's evidence was real for pcc1's own shapes, and "the counter
reads 0 on the gateway workload" was never a pcc1 claim.

### Root cause: destructured tuple literals did not retain a copied owned local

lldb on the mode-2 report (`breakpoint set -n pcc_platform_write -c '$x0 ==
2'`), reading the object at frame 1's `[x29-8]`, gave ten hits, all at the
same site in `AArch64ModuleBuilder._append_line`, all `tag=4` (str) heap cells
whose refcount word held a pointer — freed cells on the object free list. The
statement is line 362:

```python
symbol, offset = item, 0        # item: a comprehension element (Dyn), owned
...
symbol = symbol.strip()         # rebinding released the shared string
```

`_emit_tuple_unpack_assign` bound each element of a destructured *literal*
through the tuple-unpack store protocol, whose default ("non-Dyn is owned, Dyn
is borrowed") is written for `py_tuple_get` results. A Dyn `Name` element was
therefore bound as borrowed without clearing the target's loop-carried owned
flag, so the next owned store released the borrowed pointer; a non-Dyn `Name`
element was bound as owned without a retain. Either way two locals owned one
reference. Reproduced on the host in 3 s (flags off, probe 1: 100 misses per
150 items; plain `symbol = item`: 0).

Fix: `_emit_destructured_literal_element` (assignment_statement_lowering.py)
— a `Name` element that is an owned local or `except ... as e` binding takes
its own reference (`pcc_gc_retain`) before any target is stored, so
`a, b = b, a` also survives the release of the old values; every other element
keeps the existing protocol. After the fix the shape reads 0 under every
combination of the four flags and probe on/off, and the program survives with
the probe off. Regression: `tests/python/test_tuple_literal_assignment_ownership.py`.

### Exposing this class without lldb

- `PCC_GC_REFCOUNT_PROVENANCE_PROBE=3`: report and abort at the first miss —
  the crash report names the function.
- `PCC_GC_KNOWN_REF_CHECKS=1`: `pcc_gc_retain_known`/`release_known` take the
  checked path, so the audit covers the compiler-proven lanes too.
- `scripts/bootstrap.sh`: every stage smoke now runs in probe mode 2 and fails
  (rc 97) on a report; `PCC_BOOTSTRAP_SMOKE_REFCOUNT_AUDIT=0` opts out.
- The counter was the signal all along (it moved on pcc1); nothing read it.


## Update — 2026-09-19: where the LLVM-O2 codegen gap actually lives

The 2026-09-08 census attributed 61% of the self backend's excess instructions
to frame load/store and named "the block-local register allocator's
call-crossing/PHI spills" as owner 1. This update replaces that description
with a count, per value, of *why* each scalar SSA definition keeps its slot.

`scripts/probe_self_backend_value_classes.py` wraps the allocator and
classifies every scalar definition of a module, using the same facts the
allocator itself computes (function-level live intervals on, so the numbers
are the best case of the current design):

```
                                        py_obj   py_dict   py_list
scalar definitions                        2969      3152      3623
  already assigned a register             1610      1268      1842
  call result, crosses another call        337       678       474
  call result, no call until last use      154       142       203
  call result, only feeds the next call     10        61        65
  ordinary value crossing a call (ptr)      41       150       183
  ordinary value crossing a call (int)      15        42        40
  PHI input                                361       455       299
  last use is a call operand                296       225       401
  no non-PHI use                           145       131       116
```

### The single structural cause

`_REGISTER_POOL` in `self_backend_aarch64_darwin_regalloc.py` is
`(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8)`. Those are caller-saved under AAPCS64, and the
backend uses **no callee-saved register at all** — a grep for `x19`..`x28`
across `pcc/backend/self_backend_aarch64_darwin*.py` returns nothing outside
comments. A value that is live across a call therefore cannot be in a register
by construction, which is exactly what `_interval_touches_call` encodes.

LLVM's O0 pipeline (RegAllocFast) has the same shape, which is why self ≈
LLVM -O0. What RegAllocGreedy adds at O2 is not a cleverer heuristic over the
same pool: it allocates over the *full* register file, and the values it keeps
in callee-saved registers across calls are precisely the rows above that pcc
must spill. Those rows are 393 of 2969 in `py_obj` (13%), 870 of 3152 in
`py_dict` (28%) and 697 of 3623 in `py_list` (19%).

### Port order this implies

1. **Call results whose interval touches no other call** (164 / 203 / 268).
   These need no new register class: the result arrives in `x0` and one `mov`
   into a pool register replaces a slot store plus a reload at every use.
   Implemented behind `PCC_SELF_CALL_RESULT_REGISTERS` (default off,
   `tests/python/test_self_backend_call_result_registers.py`); the
   throughput measurement is still pending.
2. **A callee-saved pool (`x19`-`x28`)**, with prologue/epilogue save/restore
   and spill weights in the RegAllocGreedy sense
   (`~/pcc_refs/llvm-project-20.1.8-full-depth1/llvm/lib/CodeGen/CalcSpillWeights.cpp`).
   This is the row set above and the largest single block of the 2.43x.
   Constraint from the GC, not from the ABI: a *managed pointer* in a
   callee-saved register must still be visible to the precise stack map at
   every safepoint, so either the stack map learns to describe registers or
   pointer values stay on the slot path and only integers take this route.
   The census splits the two for that reason (ptr 41/150/183, int 15/42/40).
3. **PHI values and PHI inputs** (361 / 455 / 299 inputs). Requires the PHI
   elimination in `emit_phi_assignments` to be register-aware rather than
   slot-to-slot.
4. **Call operands** (296 / 225 / 401). Smallest of the four and the most
   delicate: ABI argument setup overwrites `x1`-`x8` before every operand has
   been copied, which is why `_interval_touches_call` treats a value whose last
   use is a call operand as spilled.

Claim boundary: three runtime modules on Darwin arm64, host `pcc`, allocator
facts only. It is not a QPS measurement and not a claim that the four slices
sum to the measured 2.43x emitter gap.


## Update — 2026-09-19: a double free is now named where it happens

Removing the refcount provenance probe turned two latent ownership defects
into crashes, and both landed arbitrarily far from their cause. The first was
the destructured-literal retain above. The second still reproduces, and
chasing it through lldb cost more than writing the check that names it.

The allocator's object free lists are intrusive: a freed cell's first word is
the list link. Freeing one cell twice therefore puts it on its list twice, and
a later pair of allocations hands the same address to two owners. Neither
owner is wrong at the point it writes, so the failure appears as something
else entirely -- `EXC_ARM_DA_ALIGN` on a release store inside
`pcc_allocator_alloc_object`, or a `TypeError` raised by code that never
touched the object.

`free()` now refuses a cell it has already taken. The marker is a poison word,
not the granule lifecycle word:

```
FREE_LIST_POISON at [cell + 8]   written by pcc_allocator_put_small_object
                                 cleared by pcc_allocator_take_small_object
                                 overwritten by every live object's (tag, flags)
```

The lifecycle word cannot serve. `pcc_allocator_refill_small_object` links
freshly carved cells through the same push path with the word already reading
`GC_STATE_FREE`, and the GC retires a granule to `GC_STATE_FREE` *before*
calling `free()` on it. Both were measured as false positives first: the push
site reported 1,803,656 double frees on a 1000-object program, and the free
site with the lifecycle word still reported 2,046. With the poison word the
same program reports zero.

A cell that still carries the poison is counted in
`pcc_allocator_double_frees` (`PCC_GC_COUNTER_ALLOCATOR_DOUBLE_FREES`,
telemetry metric 118) and dropped rather than linked, so the heap stays
self-consistent and the run reaches a diagnosable point instead of corrupting
an unrelated object. Under the ownership-audit mode -- the same
`PCC_GC_REFCOUNT_PROVENANCE_PROBE` knob, 2 or 3 -- the first one is reported on
stderr, and 3 aborts so the crash report names the caller.

Every bootstrap stage smoke runs under that mode and fails the stage (rc 97) on
either report, printing the smoke's stderr. The two ownership defects this
series found were both invisible to the gateway benchmark and to the
bottom-line gates; they are now a build gate.

Regression: `tests/python/test_allocator_double_free_detector.py`, which pins
the push/pop poison pairing (every size class clears it, or the next free of
that cell reports a double free that did not happen), the check's position
before the link, the counter's telemetry route, and zero reports on an
ordinary object-churning program.


## Update — 2026-09-19: py_incref stopped at type tag 500

With the destructured-literal retain fixed and the double-free check in place,
the Stage1 smoke still reported one refcount operation on a non-object. Audit
mode 3 named the site directly from the crash report:

```
pcc_platform_abort
py_incref
py_tuple_get_known                                  the callee's argument unpack
user_pcc_backend_macho_archive__inspect_member_native_adapter
py_func_call_kwargs / py_obj_call
user_pcc_backend_macho_parallel___nested_run_worker
```

The argument tuple built by the caller held a dead `_PendingMember`. The
element had been stored with `py_tuple_set_item`, which retains through
`py_incref`, and the caller then released its own reference -- balanced, unless
the retain did nothing.

It did nothing. Both refcount mirrors screened their operand with

```python
tag < PY_TYPE_NONE
or (tag > PY_TYPE_CPY_HANDLE and tag < PY_TYPE_USER)
or (tag > 500 and pcc_capi_is_cext_type_tag(tag) == 0)     # <-- here
```

and returned without touching the header when it matched. User-class tags are
handed out from `PY_TYPE_USER_CLASS_START` (104) upward, one per class in the
compiled closure; C-extension tags start at `PY_TYPE_CEXT_TAG_BASE` (0x10000).
The literal 500 is neither boundary. Every user class past roughly the 440th
was therefore unrefcounted: `py_incref` and `py_decref` were silently no-ops
for its instances. The crashing object's tag was 541.

Nothing small reaches 500 classes, which is why the gateway benchmark, the
bottom-line gates and every focused test missed it for as long as the guard has
existed. pcc's own closure crosses it, so pcc1 stopped refcounting a subset of
its own instances -- and the failure surfaced as a `TypeError` in unrelated
code, because the freed cell was reused.

Fixed in both mirrors: four guards in `py_obj.py`, three in `py_obj.c` and one
in `pcc_threads.c` now compare against the C-extension tag base, which is named
`PY_TYPE_CEXT_TAG_BASE` in `py_runtime.h`. The pcc-Python mirror spells it as
the literal `(0x10000)`, matching `py_capi_type_runtime.py`: comparing against
the *imported* name lowers through `py_obj_ge`, the generic object comparison,
and segfaults on the first refcount. That cost one rebuild cycle and is
recorded in the regression test.

Regression: `tests/python/test_user_class_tag_refcount_boundary.py` compiles a
620-class program and checks that an instance of one of the last classes
survives 200 round trips through a call's argument tuple with the unmanaged and
double-free counters at zero.

### Stage1 now passes

```
scripts/bootstrap.sh --backend self --stage 1      rc=0  (6m47s)
  smoke under PCC_GC_REFCOUNT_PROVENANCE_PROBE=3 (abort at the first report)
pcc1 smoke, five audit configurations                rc=0, 0 unmanaged, 0 double frees
  default / probe=2 / probe=3 / probe=2 + PCC_GC_KNOWN_REF_CHECKS=1 / probe=3 + known
bottom-line gates (host pcc and cc absent)           C 'hello 15 36' rc=42; Python '135' rc=0; libSystem only
```

Three ownership defects were between the probe-off default and a working
pcc1, and all three were invisible to every benchmark in the repo. Stage2 is
the remaining gate.

## Update — 2026-09-19: native string decoding repeatedly compiled a late regex

A source-frozen native Stage2 attempt reached its 5.5 GiB tree limit while
`pcc.cli_bootstrap` codegen overlapped a ~3.08 GB coordinator. Its native
worker was sampled using its own binary identity; replay without the resident
coordinator succeeds in 122.464 s at 3,402,514,432 bytes peak tree RSS.
This separates the coexistence limit from a codegen capability failure.

In the actual worker's 2,302-sample trace, `_pcc_re_core__compile` accounts for
354 self samples (15.4%). The compile subtree includes 494 samples below
`decode_llvm_c_string` and 62 below `emit_typed_initializer`. The first-64
immutable regex cache falls back to compilation for later patterns. The
cstring decoder called `re.fullmatch('[0-9A-Fa-f]{2}', ...)` once per escaped
byte, so one late pattern was repeatedly compiled. A separate coordinator
startup trace contains waiting `read` frames under host-find-spec probes;
those blocked samples are not on-CPU attribution.

The decoder now checks the fixed two-character ASCII alphabet with a native
string operation and reuses the slice for conversion. Existing non-hex escape
behavior, all 256 byte values, invalid/truncated tokens and non-byte Unicode
behavior are pinned against the previous decoder. 73 decoder/token-classifier
tests pass.

Native component measurement, not a Stage2 speed claim: both old and new
function bodies were compiled into the same binary against the same runtime.
Inputs are the eight longest literal strings from the frozen cli_bootstrap
source, rendered with the owned IR constant formatter, plus an all-byte
sample (7,828 decoded bytes). Eighty distinct complex patterns prime the cache
before the measured decoder. All nine decoded outputs match each other and
the original bytes. Three alternating pairs of ten iterations yield median
1.520801 s old / 0.201190 s new, **7.559x for this decoder**. The original
worker and a newly built compiler still require a controlled comparison before
claiming end-to-end improvement.

Evidence: `/private/tmp/pcc-stage2-native-ayfmxjgz/`:
`codegen-worker.folded`, `replay-cli.result.json`, `cstring-pairs.json`,
